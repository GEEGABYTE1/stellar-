# Stellar Model Classification ü™ê

Simple Machine Learning Classification Model that compares 
3 classification algorithms (based on accuracy):
 - Kernel SVM 
 - KNN 
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

for whether given telescope data found a galaxy, quasar, or star. 

Random Forest and KNN were the highest performing algorithms with 93% and 90% respectively. Can be found in the files with `PCA` labelled on them.

PCA was conducted for visualization with relatively high accuracy.

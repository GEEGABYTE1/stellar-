# Stellar Model Classification ü™ê

Simple Machine Learning Classification Model that compares 
3 classification algorithms (based on accuracy):
 - Kernel SVM 
 - KNN 
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest 

Random Forest and KNN were the highest performing algorithms with 93% and 90% respectively. 

PCA was conducted for visualization with relatively high accuracy.
